"Sep 12, 2022",Blah B.,"It is very difficult to maintain this level of quality outside of Japan, especially when it comes to neta and overall to Sushi but this place did very well. It is not cheap to eat here but the quality and service speaks for itself. The rice was delicious, hard to find in Germany in my opinion. If you are Japanese and feel homesick, this place will give you a hint of what home feels like, Ittamae was really friendly too. Their sake list is decent, some Dassai 45 and 23, some Kubota but given the price I think it was not Manju. When in doubt you can ask, they are very happy to give out the correct information. Everything tasted great, I would definitely recommend this place! His marinated maguro is especially tasty!!!",5
"Feb 26, 2021",Sam S.,Good quality sushi that is freshly prepared and well presented. Like most places it's take out only at the moment and the chef is a slightly grumpy old man that makes brilliant sushi. Best to order a day earlier if you want something special or different. He was certainly not happy with my last minute order for a vegetarian omakase :-) but in the end he made a fabulous vegetarian selection. The fish here is super fresh and lovely. Happily come here again albeit it's not cheap. Great sushi is rarely cheap and that is certainly the case in Munich.,5
"Mar 19, 2019",Jeanette Y.,"Their business hour said it closes at 11, we went in at 9:45 and they told us they are closed! I guess the rating is not for the food nor the service, just the fact that they list the time that is not correct and we walked 20 mins there for nothing at a night that's about 0° outside",1
"Apr 9, 2017",Joshua Z.,"We ran into this restaurant few months ago and the experience was unexpectedly satisfactory. The decorations respect its feature and the staffs are all Japanese. The set meal offered during the dinner is well-prepared and the service is perfect. But it lacks something unique, something different from other Japanese restaurant. Maybe I will be impressed next time? Still a 4-star for the quality and authenticity.",4
"Jul 2, 2015",Hadley K.,"What an awesome place; rivals many Bay Area and a number of Japanese restaurants in Asia. Authentic with excellent service. The fish was fresh and the udon so clean-tasting with no saltiness. One gripe would be an extremely small portion of tempura for 20€ but one can't complain about the taste and the perfection of the batter. If you want the real thing, this place is probably it for Munich.",5
"Feb 13, 2014",Ali E.,"Nice atmosphere and device. We got the menu for two, which was decent amount of food. Appetizers are very good. Overall Fish quality is also good but still not top niche. Also a bit expensive for the quality...still recommended for a lovely dinner :)",4
"Jun 28, 2013",Qype User (lovest…),"Wow. Got a recommendation from a friend for here and this is by far the best Sushi I had in a long time. Mind you, this is not the Sushi that is popular in Germany: cheap, all-you-can-eat from the conveyer belt. This is prime quality, prepared with expertise but worth every Cent. Service is attentive and polite.",5
